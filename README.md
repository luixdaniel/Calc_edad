# Calc_edad
**Live Demo**: [https://luixdaniel.github.io/Calc_edad/](https://luixdaniel.github.io/Calc_edad/)
This project is a web page that checks whether a user is of legal age or underage. It is developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and is fully **responsive**, adapting to different devices and screen sizes.

## Features

- The user must enter their age in a text field.
- The system validates:
  - If the field is empty, a warning message is displayed.
  - If the entered age is invalid (such as a negative number or text), an error message is shown.
  - If the user is under 18 years old, a message indicates they are underage.
  - If the user is 18 or older, a message confirms they are of legal age.
- Responsive design to work on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure of the site.
- **CSS3** – visual styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript** – logic for validation and control flow.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
2. Enter your age in the text field.
3. Press the button to validate.
4. A message will appear indicating whether you are of legal age or underage.
